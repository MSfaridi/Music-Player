# Music-Player
This music player project is a simple web-based application that allows users to play, pause, and switch between different songs. It features a sleek design with a thumbnail image representing the current song, basic controls for playback, and dynamic updates to the song's title and artist. The project uses HTML for the structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for functionality.
